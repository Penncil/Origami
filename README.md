## Description

A radar chart is a popular visualization tool to compare multiple individuals (e.g., treatments, hospitals, etc.) across multiple quantitative attributes plotted on axes starting from a central point. Historically, many studies have used the area enclosed by the points on the axes to rank the overall performance of different individuals for multi-criteria decision-making. However, this area can be misleading because it depends on the ordering of the attributes on the axes. We suggest a simple and effective alternative, called the origami plot, that is invariant to the ordering of the attributes while still maintaining the intuitive visual appeal of the radar chart. We provide several formulations and examples to illustrate different uses of the origami plot for understanding multivariate relationships.

## Example

By running the `origami_example_run.R` with main function `origami_func.R` using the sample data `sample_data.csv`, a five-outcome origami plot as follows can be produced:
